FB Messenger Bot & Custom AI
A Facebook Messenger bot and custom AI capable of understanding user queries and providing appropriate responses.

Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude to Yelda for giving me this opportunity and trust to proceed to the next stage of my apprenticeship application after our recent job interview.

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to host the project as it's a paid service.

Disclaimer:
Before running the application, please follow these steps:

1: Ensure you add the .JSON file to your system path. The file can be located in the project directory, specifically in the root directory of the project folder.

2: Navigate to the project server directory (FB_Messenger_bot/server/.env) and assign your path to GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS. 
    Replace <your json path> with your .json file path. Remember to add it to your system path and restart your terminal.

3: Once you are done with the above steps, install ngrok to test the bot locally. 
    You'll need to create a Facebook page and link it to https://developers.facebook.com/ (you'll also need to create a Messenger app).

4: Replace the PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN in the .env file (located in the server project directory) with the token generated by Facebook on your app dashboard.

5: Now, launch ngrok to create a tunnel and configure the webhook with the link provided by ngrok. Use the Forwarding link address.

6: Configure the webhook/messenger and paste the Forwarding link to the callback URL in the Facebook app dashboard. Add the verify token, the value of which is in your .env file.

7: Launch the server with npm run dev (in developers mode) or npm start.

8: You won't need to configure Dialogflow as it uses my agent and everything has been set up to minimize additional work when launching the app.

9: For the custom id, you will only need to launch the app by executing npm start in your client folder after launching the server.

Note: 
To avoid conflicts, by default, React launches at port 3000. I have configured the server to run at port 3000. 
Therefore, first, launch the server, and afterward, launch the React app to be on a different port like port 3001.
